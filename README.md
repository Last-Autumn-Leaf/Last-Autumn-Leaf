# 👋 Hi, I’m @Last-Autumn-Leaf (aka Carl-andré)

After completing an engineering degree in France, I'm finishing my studies with a dual degree in Canada. 

I am currently at the University of Sherbrooke in order to complete an IA/ML master's degree which ends in December 2022.

Outside of work, I enjoy...
- Playing volleyball
- Competitive Programming
- Anime & Manga
- Dancing, cooking and taking pictures that inspires me
